I forked the NG6-starter project because I think it has good practices and 
did not to reinvent the wheel in terms of getting setup with a dev environment. 
Should be able to just


```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


To get a better of idea of the work done
- Added the services directory from scratch
- Added the shop component based on the practices already existing in the project
- Added a couple of dependencies to speed things up
- Add product service for retrieving products/a product
- Add cart service for all cart related actions
- Added the dialog when clicking on a product for quick actions 
- Added directive
